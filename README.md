# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live and has an extensive description of the poker_game.py inner workings.

Poker game unfortunately isn't fully working - it takes 8 players no matter what the user specifies, prints out all 8 hands but doesn't print out the winner. Think that there was a just a little implementation left to do.
